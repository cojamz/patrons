    <h1>Testing the Fixes</h1>
    
    <h2>Fix 1: Turn Skipping Logic</h2>
    <p>When a player has skipped turns and buys an extra turn:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The extra turn should be consumed by the skip</li>
        <li>The skip count should be decremented</li>
        <li>The player should NOT get an actual extra turn</li>
        <li>A log message should show: "Extra turn consumed by skip (X skips remaining)"</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Fix 2: Worker Take Back from Different Quad</h2>
    <p>The purple action "gain2purpleTakeBack" should:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only show workers that are NOT on purple actions</li>
        <li>Filter out any workers placed on purple quad actions</li>
        <li>Allow taking back workers from red, yellow, blue, gold, white, black, or silver quads only</li>
    </ul>

        // Test logic explanation
        console.log("Fix 1 - Extra Turn with Skip:");
        console.log("Before: Player has 1 skip, gets extra turn effect -> Takes extra turn AND still has skip");
        console.log("After: Player has 1 skip, gets extra turn effect -> Skip decremented to 0, no extra turn taken");
        
        console.log("\nFix 2 - Purple Take Back:");
        console.log("Before: Shows all workers including those on purple actions");
        console.log("After: Only shows workers on non-purple actions");
