# Theme Exploration for Patrons

**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Status:** Brainstorming - No Decision Yet

---

## The Challenge

Need to evolve the game from abstract "colors and workers" to a concrete, printable theme with visual appeal and thematic coherence.

**Current Mechanics:**
- Worker placement on 8 colored action spaces
- 8 resource types (red, yellow, blue, purple, gold, white, black, silver)
- Each color has distinct mechanical personality:
  - Red: Worker Manipulation
  - Yellow: Resource Manipulation
  - Blue: Shop Control
  - Purple: Timing/Order
  - Gold: Victory Points
  - White: VP Trading
  - Black: Destruction/Penalty
  - Silver: Cooperation/Information
- Shops that provide special benefits
- 3 rounds, 2-4 players

## Core Mechanical Flow (User's Insight)

The "patron deity" concept creates natural flow:
1. **Give workers to a patron** (place worker on color)
2. **Receive their favor** (collect resources)
3. **Spend favor with them** (use shops for special boons)

This makes the game name "Patrons" work perfectly.
