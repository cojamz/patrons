*Updated: January 9, 2025*

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY
1. **Shop Cost Reduction** - Now player-specific instead of global

## üî¥ Critical Issues

### 1. Shop Cost Validation
- **Issue**: "Any" cost calculation may not properly validate when using specific color + any
- **Location**: Lines 6550-6590
- **Example**: Purple R1 shop (1 purple + 2 any) validation logic
- **Fix**: Ensure specific color requirement is met before allowing "any" selection

### ‚úÖ Shop Implementations - COMPLETED
- **Red R3**: Now allows repeating any player's actions (including your own)
- **Yellow R2/R3**: Both properly give gems to all other players  
- **Blue R2**: Now gains shop benefit then closes that shop
- **Note**: All shops working as designed in the game

## üü° High Priority - Game Logic

### 5. Force Red Placement Edge Cases
- **Issue**: What happens if red layer doesn't exist in game?
- **Fix**: Validate red layer exists before allowing forceRedPlacement action

### 6. White Shop VP Costs
- **Issue**: White shops cost VP but what if player doesn't have enough?
- **Current**: Validation exists but VP can now go to 0
- **Fix**: Ensure proper validation messages

### 7. ‚ùå REMOVED - Spec Error
- **Black R2 shop**: Actually steals 3 VP (working correctly)
- **Note**: Spec had incorrect information about curse effect

### 8. Gold Shop Calculations
- **Issue**: Gold shops accept "any" resources including gold itself
- **Fix**: Clarify if gold can be used for "any" cost in gold shops

### 9. Worker Placement Validation
- **Issue**: Can place workers during shop phase?
- **Fix**: Ensure phase restrictions are properly enforced

### 10. Extra Workers vs Skip Turns
- **Issue**: Complex interaction when player has both

- **Fix**: Document intended behavior clearly

## üü¢ Medium Priority - UI/UX

### 11. Action Description Clarity
- **Issue**: Some action descriptions don't match effects
- **Examples**: 
  - "Trade All ‚≠ê for ‚≠ê" is confusing
  - "Turn 2*" should be clearer

### 12. Shop Phase Indicators
- **Issue**: Not clear when in shop vs worker phase
- **Fix**: Add clear phase indicator for all players

### 13. Resource Selection UI
- **Issue**: Gem selection modal can be confusing with many resources
- **Fix**: Group by color, show running total

### 14. VP Breakdown Display
- **Issue**: Some VP sources missing from tooltip
- **Examples**: Purple automatic VP, shop purchases
- **Fix**: Ensure all VP sources tracked

### 15. Turn Order Visualization
- **Issue**: Snake draft direction not visually clear
- **Fix**: Add arrows or indicators showing turn flow

## üîµ Low Priority - Polish

### 16. Animation & Feedback
- **Issue**: No visual feedback for actions
- **Fix**: Add subtle animations for resource changes, worker placement

### 17. Sound Effects

## üü® Balance & Design

### 26. Victory Shop Balance
- **Issue**: Some victory shops much stronger than others
