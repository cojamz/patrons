## Complete Layer Specifications

### Red - Worker Manipulation

**Actions:**
- Round 1:
  - `gain3red`: Gain 3 red
  - `gain2red`: Gain 2 red  
  - `redHybrid1`: +1 red + swap workers (both players get actions)
  - `redRepeatAction`: Repeat an action that one of your workers is on
- Round 2:
  - `forceRedPlacement`: Other players must place on red until red layer is full
  - `redHybrid2`: +1 red + swap workers (only you get action)
- Round 3:
  - `redRepeatAll`: Repeat the action of each of your workers (in any order you choose)

**Shops:**
- R1: 1 red + 1 any = Repeat a worker's action
- R2: 2 red + 2 any = Place the next player's worker
- R3: 3 red + 3 any = Repeat all actions taken this round by any player
- Victory Points: 5 red = 3 VP

**Automatic VP:** Gain 1 VP each time you use or repeat a red layer action (including if you swap a worker into red)

### Yellow - Resource Manipulation

**Actions:**
- Round 1:
  - `gain3yellow`: Gain 3 different colored cubes
  - `gain2yellow`: Gain 2 different colored cubes
  - `steal2Gems`: Steal 2 cubes
  - `yellowHybrid1`: +1 yellow + trade in any number of cubes
- Round 2:
  - `steal3Gems`: Steal 3 cubes
  - `yellowHybrid2`: +1 yellow + double next gain (doesn't stack with shop)
- Round 3:
  - `yellowSwapResources`: Choose any player - swap all resources with them

**Shops:**
- R1: 1 yellow + 1 any = Double your next gain action
- R2: 2 yellow + 2 any = Gain 5 gems of any color
- R3: 3 yellow + 3 any = Gain 7 gems of any color
- Victory Points: 5 any = 3 VP

**Automatic VP:** At end of each round: +1 VP for each different color gem you have

### Blue - Shop Control

**Actions:**

- R3: 3 blue + 3 any = Gain any shop benefit (even if closed)
- Victory Points: 5 blue = 5 VP

**Automatic VP:** Gain 1 VP each time you use any shop (*Using the "Gain a shop benefit" action counts as using a shop for VP purposes)

  - `playThreeWorkers`: Play 3 more workers this turn
- Round 3:
  - `gain4purpleWaitAll`: Gain 4 purple. Skip turns until everyone else has run out of workers, then play all

**Shops:**
- R1: 1 purple + 1 any = Take an extra turn after this one
- R2: 2 purple + 2 any = Play 2 more workers this turn
- R3: 3 purple + 3 any = Play the rest of your workers

   - Yellow: Calculate at ADVANCE_ROUND based on gem diversity
   - Blue: Trigger on ANY shop purchase by ANY player

2. **Shop Status:**
   - Need to add `closedShops` and `flippedShops` to game state
   - Shops can be closed by blue actions
   - Victory shops can be flipped too

3. **Cost Modifications:**
   - Need to track cost modifiers in game state
   - Apply modifiers when checking shop affordability

## Summary of Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. **Shop Effects Implementation**: Several shop effects need implementation
   - Yellow R2/R3: Gain gems + everyone gains
   - Red R3: Repeat all actions taken this round
   - Blue R2: Gain benefit then close shop
   - Blue R3: Flip all shop statuses (shop effect)

2. **Yellow trade any number**: The yellowHybrid1 action needs proper implementation

3. **Purple layer cleanup**: Remove outdated actions and verify against original spec

### Medium Priority
- Comprehensive testing of all systems
- Edge case handling for complex interactions

### Low Priority
- Performance optimizations
- Additional UI polish

## Complex Interaction Considerations

### Action Chaining
1. **Red Repeat Actions + Other Layers**
   - Red repeat can trigger blue shop benefits
   - Red repeat can trigger yellow steals
   - ✅ Infinite loop prevention added (max recursion depth of 5)
   - Red repeat awards VP for each repeated red action

2. **Blue Shop Control + Cost Modifications**
   - Cost mods affect all players globally
   - Closed shops can still be accessed via blue actions
   - Shop flipping affects victory shops too
   - Blue shop benefit actions properly execute shop effects

3. **Yellow Resource Manipulation**
   - Stealing allows targeted gem theft from specific players
   - Swapping exchanges ALL resources between players
   - Double gain effect consumed after first use
   - Trade any number allows flexible gem conversion

4. **Purple Timing**
   - Extra workers apply in the following round (2 additional)
   - Turn order changes take effect next round
   - Multiple worker placement happens within same turn
   - Shop benefit hybrid gives access to any R1 shop effect

## Completed Improvements
1. **Infinite Loop Protection**: Added recursion depth tracking to executeAction
2. **Purple Actions**: Restored original simpler purple actions per spec
3. **Shop Effect Execution**: Blue shop benefit actions now properly execute effects
4. **VP Source Tracking**: All VP awards include source category
5. **Edge Case Handling**: Proper validation for worker swaps, resource trades
