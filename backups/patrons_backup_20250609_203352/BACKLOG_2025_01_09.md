## üî¥ Critical Issues Remaining

### 1. Purple R1 Shop Cost Bug
- **Issue**: Takes 2 purple instead of 1 purple + 2 any
- **Location**: Lines 6550-6590 (auto gem selection)
- **Root Cause**: Likely in fallback when modal cancelled
- **Priority**: HIGH - affects game economy

### 2. Blue Automatic VP Not Triggering
- **Issue**: automaticVPs.blue = true but no VP awarded
- **Location**: Shop purchase handlers
- **Fix Needed**: Add debug logging to trace issue
- **Priority**: HIGH - major mechanic broken

### 3. Shop State Not Persisting
- **Issue**: closedShops resets between rounds
- **Location**: ADVANCE_ROUND handler
- **Fix**: Preserve closedShops except natural openings
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - affects strategy

## üü° High Priority - Game Logic

### 5. Force Red Placement Edge Cases
- **Issue**: What happens if red layer doesn't exist in game?
- **Fix**: Validate red layer exists before allowing forceRedPlacement action

### 6. White Shop VP Costs
- **Issue**: White shops cost VP but what if player doesn't have enough?
- **Current**: Validation exists but VP can now go to 0
- **Fix**: Ensure proper validation messages

### 7. ‚ùå REMOVED - Spec Error
- **Black R2 shop**: Actually steals 3 VP (working correctly)
- **Note**: Spec had incorrect information about curse effect

### 8. Gold Shop Calculations
- **Issue**: Gold shops accept "any" resources including gold itself
- **Fix**: Clarify if gold can be used for "any" cost in gold shops

### 9. Worker Placement Validation
- **Issue**: Can place workers during shop phase?
- **Fix**: Ensure phase restrictions are properly enforced

### 10. Extra Workers vs Skip Turns
- **Issue**: Complex interaction when player has both
- **Example**: Extra turn consumed by skip - is this intended?
- **Fix**: Document intended behavior clearly

## üü¢ Medium Priority - UI/UX

### 11. Action Description Clarity
- **Issue**: Some action descriptions don't match effects
- **Examples**: 
  - "Trade All ‚≠ê for ‚≠ê" is confusing
  - "Turn 2*" should be clearer
- **Fix**: Update action titles and descriptions

### 12. Shop Phase Indicators
- **Issue**: Not clear when in shop vs worker phase
- **Fix**: Add clear phase indicator for all players

### 13. Resource Selection UI
- **Issue**: Gem selection modal can be confusing with many resources
- **Fix**: Group by color, show running total

### 14. VP Breakdown Display
- **Issue**: Some VP sources missing from tooltip
- **Examples**: Purple automatic VP, shop purchases
- **Fix**: Ensure all VP sources tracked

### 15. Turn Order Visualization
- **Issue**: Snake draft direction not visually clear
- **Fix**: Add arrows or indicators showing turn flow

## üîµ Low Priority - Polish

### 16. Animation & Feedback
- **Issue**: No visual feedback for actions
- **Fix**: Add subtle animations for resource changes, worker placement

### 17. Sound Effects
- **Issue**: No audio feedback
- **Fix**: Add optional sound effects for actions

### 18. Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Issue**: All interaction is click-based
- **Fix**: Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### 19. Game History/Log
- **Issue**: Action log is limited and disappears
- **Fix**: Add expandable game history with filtering

- **Issue**: Can't watch games without playing
- **Fix**: Add read-only spectator access

## üü£ Multiplayer Specific

- **Issue**: Race conditions when multiple players act
- **Fix**: Add action queue system

## üü® Balance & Design

### 26. Victory Shop Balance
- **Issue**: Some victory shops much stronger than others
- **Example**: Yellow is 5 any for 3 VP vs others at 5 specific
- **Fix**: Review and adjust costs

### 27. Automatic VP Scaling
- **Issue**: Some automatic VPs scale too well
- **Example**: Gold VP can be massive with hoarding
- **Fix**: Consider caps or diminishing returns

### 28. First Player Advantage
- **Issue**: Going first is very strong
- **Fix**: Consider compensation for later players

### 29. Resource Scarcity
- **Issue**: Some colors much easier to get than others
