## Critical Issues (Breaking Game)

### 1. ‚ùå Yellow Actions Not Working in Multiplayer
- Gain 3* doesn't update resources after selection
- "Yellow is just straight up not working in multiplayer"

- **Still Need**: Verify UPDATE_RESOURCES is working

### 2. üü¢ Multiplayer Sync Missing Fields

- **Partial Fix Applied**: Fixed gameLayers check
- **Still Need**: Test thoroughly

## Resource Issues

### 5. ‚ùå Gold Conversion Setting Instead of Adding
- "Turn 2* to 2 gold also set my gold state to 2 instead of adding"

- Works in local but not multiplayer

### 7. ‚ùå Red Shop Repeat Not Giving Resources
- "Turn of Gain 3 red, then buying the red shop, and repeating that action didn't give the appropriate VP and also did not give the player 3 Red"

## VP Issues

### 8. ‚ùå Auto VP from Non-Existent Quads
- "Auto VP is being added from quads that aren't in the game"
- **Investigation**: Code checks gameLayers before adding auto VP

### 9. üü¢ Purple VP Sources Not Showing
- "Showing VP sources on hover-over doesn't show VP from Purple quad"
- **Fix Applied**: Added vpSources tracking for Purple

### 10. ‚ùå Blue Automatic VP Not Working

- "Sometimes shops aren't giving VP per the blue condition"
- **Partial Fix Applied**: Added automaticVPs to initial state

- "R1 red shop didnt give VP"

## Shop Issues

- Taking 2 purple instead of 1 purple + 2 any
- Not granting extra turn
- **Partial Fix Applied**: Fixed cost calculation

### 14. ‚ùå Shop State Not Persisting
- "Does the shop state carry over between rounds? It should"
- closedShops should persist except R2/R3 shops opening naturally

### 15. ‚ùå Shop Toggle UI Sync
- "If a shop is toggled on and off it should show in the UI for all players"

### 16. ‚ùå Shop Cost Increase Not Stacking
- "Repeating the action of increasing shop costs did not further increase shop costs"
- **Investigation**: Uses ADD_SHOP_COST_MODIFIER which should stack

### 17. ‚ùå R2/R3 Shops Not Showing for P1
- "R2 and R3 shops are shown as available to P2 P3 and P4 but not P1"

## UI/UX Issues

### 18. ‚ùå Purple Skip Turn Not Working

- **Fix Applied**: Fixed double-decrement in snake draft

### 19. ‚ùå Extra Turn Validation
- "If have no workers and try to pay for an extra turn, you should receive an error"
- Should prevent purchase and not charge resources

### 20. üü¢ Worker Placement Cancellation

- **Fix Applied**: Added UNDO_LAST_WORKER action

### 21. ‚ùå Round Advance Screen Issues
- "Two people clicking advance in the end of round screen ended up going right to round 3"
- Should dismiss for all players when one advances

### 22. ‚ùå Red Swap Workers UI

- Currently shows player selection instead of action selection

### 23. ‚ùå Player Cards Order
- "Player cards should be put in turn order"
