# Context Save - January 8, 2025

## Session Summary
Fixed critical multiplayer sync issues that were causing most game problems.

## Major Fixes Applied

### 1. React Stale Closure Fix (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: useEffect was capturing old state in closure, syncing zeros to Firebase
**Solution**: Added `stateRef` to always access latest state in setTimeout
```javascript
const stateRef = React.useRef(state);
stateRef.current = state;
// In setTimeout: use stateRef.current
```

### 2. Modal Display Fix
**Problem**: Modals showed to all players in multiplayer
**Solution**: Only show to current player
```javascript
state.modal && (!state.roomCode || state.myPlayerId === state.currentPlayer)
```

### 3. Firebase Echo Prevention
**Problem**: Own updates echo back from Firebase, overwriting local changes
**Solution**: Track lastUpdatedBy and ignore own echoes
```javascript
if (action.gameState.lastUpdatedBy === state.myPlayerId) {
    return state; // Ignore our own echo
}
```

### 4. Sync Completeness
- Added all 8 resource types to SYNC_GAME_STATE
- Added automaticVPs to sync
- Added vpSources preservation
- Handle undefined occupiedSpaces from Firebase

### 5. Debounced Sync
- 200ms debounce prevents rapid-fire syncing
- Reduces race conditions

## Current Bug Status

### âœ… Fixed
- Yellow gain actions now update resources in multiplayer
- Resource sync race conditions resolved
- Modal display issues fixed
- React hooks error in PlayerCard
- Local game syntax errors

### ðŸ”´ Still Broken (High Priority)
1. **Gold VP shop** - Still showing despite null return in code
2. **Purple R1 shop** - Taking 2 purple instead of 1 purple + 2 any
3. **Force red placement** - Breaking game, players can't pick red
4. **Blue/Red automatic VP** - Not triggering despite fixes
5. **Shop state persistence** - Not carrying between rounds
6. **Purple skip turn** - Not working in snake draft

### Key Code Locations
- Main game file: `/Users/cory/Patrons/react-game.html`
- Sync function: Line 1402 `syncGameState`
- Reducer: Line 250 `gameReducer`
- UPDATE_RESOURCES: Line 278
- SYNC_GAME_STATE: Line 1149
- Modal display: Line 7608
- Shop data: Around line 6500+

## Firebase Sync Architecture
Currently using full state sync with issues:
- Bidirectional sync causes loops
- No conflict resolution
- Race conditions with multiple updaters

Recommended: Move to action-based sync or authoritative host model

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Yellow gain with extra workers
- [ ] Purple shop costs and extra turn
- [ ] Force red placement
- [ ] Blue automatic VP on shop use
- [ ] Round advancement clearing actions
- [ ] Shop toggle persistence

## Next Steps
1. Fix Gold VP shop removal
2. Fix Purple R1 shop cost calculation
3. Fix force red placement validation
4. Implement proper automatic VP tracking
5. Consider refactoring to action-based sync
