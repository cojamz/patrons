# Context Save - January 9, 2025 Final Session

## Session Summary
This session focused on fixing critical bugs from playtesting and improving the user experience with validation warnings.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Game-Breaking Issues
- **actualCost undefined error** - Fixed CompactVictoryShop by defining actualCost outside handlePurchase
- **Snake draft skip turns** - Fixed double skip at reversal points  
- **Persistent effects** - "Can place 2 more workers" now clears properly
- **Force red placement** - Fixed to only check current round actions

### 2. UI/UX Improvements
- **End Turn button** - Now red and pulsing when turn is complete
- **Red shop UI** - Always shows selection even with one option
- **Layout shift fix** - Added overflow controls for modals
- **Shop descriptions** - Fixed incorrect descriptions in Blue R3 action

### 3. Shop System Fixes
- **Shop cost modifiers** - Fixed state vs currentState reference bug
- **R3 shop implementations** - Verified and corrected all R3 shops
- **Blue R3 action** - Fixed stale state issue when executing benefits
- **Implementation spec** - Updated to match actual game behavior

### 4. Resource Waste Prevention
Added comprehensive validation warnings for:
- Duplicate effects (extra turns, double gain)
- Insufficient resources/workers
- Actions with no valid targets
- Shops that would have no effect

Changed from hard blocks to confirmable warnings to preserve strategic depth.

### 5. Swap Worker Improvements
- Cannot swap onto or off swap actions
- R2 swap only gives destination action benefit
- Validation prevents wasting worker when no swaps available

## Technical Details

### Key Code Changes

1. **CompactVictoryShop Fix** (Line ~7550):
```javascript
const actualCost = calculateActualCost(shop.cost, currentPlayer.shopCostModifier);
```

2. **Snake Draft Skip Fix** (Line ~624):
```javascript
// Special handling for reversal points
if (isAtReversalPoint && currentSkips > 1) {
    // Only consume one skip at reversal
    newSkippedTurns[nextPlayerId] = currentSkips - 1;
}
```

3. **Warning System** (Lines ~7095-7172):
```javascript
const proceed = confirm('WARNING: You already have an extra turn queued! This purchase will have no additional effect. Continue anyway?');
if (!proceed) return;
```

4. **Blue R3 State Fix** (Line ~3464):
```javascript
await executeShopBenefit(choice.color, choice.round, player, dispatch, currentState, recursionDepth + 1);
```

## Files Modified
- `/Users/cory/Patrons/react-game.html` - Main game file (28 fixes)
- `/Users/cory/Patrons/IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` - Corrected shop descriptions
- `/Users/cory/Patrons/CLAUDE.md` - Updated with current status
- `/Users/cory/Patrons/PLAYTEST_BUGS_STATUS.md` - Added 28 completed fixes

## Remaining High Priority Issues

### 1. Purple R1 Shop Cost Bug
- Takes 2 purple instead of 1 purple + 2 any
- Likely in automatic gem selection fallback

### 2. Blue Automatic VP
- Not triggering despite automaticVPs.blue = true
- Need to add debug logging

### 3. Shop State Persistence
- closedShops not carrying between rounds properly

## Testing Notes
- All fixes tested in local play
- Warning system provides good UX without breaking strategy
- R3 shops now all working correctly
- Swap worker mechanics properly restricted

## Deployment Status
- All changes pushed to GitHub
- Ready for multiplayer testing
- No breaking changes introduced

## Next Steps
1. Fix Purple R1 shop cost calculation
2. Debug Blue automatic VP system
3. Fix shop state persistence
4. Comprehensive multiplayer testing
