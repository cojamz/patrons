# Context Save - January 9, 2025

## Session Summary
Major bug fixes focused on shop cost reduction, skip turns, doubling effects, and UI improvements. Resolved multiple syntax errors that prevented game from loading.

## Major Fixes Applied

### 1. Shop Cost Reduction - Player Specific (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Shop cost reduction was applying to ALL players instead of just the activating player
**Solution**: Moved shopCostModifier from global state to per-player property
```javascript
// Before (global):
shopCostModifier: 0

// After (per-player):
players: players.map(p => ({ ...p, shopCostModifier: 0 }))

// Usage:
const currentPlayer = state.players.find(p => p.id === state.currentPlayer);
anyRequired = Math.max(0, anyRequired + (currentPlayer?.shopCostModifier || 0));
```

### 2. Skip Turns in Snake Draft
**Problem**: Skip turns weren't working when snake draft reversed direction
**Solution**: Removed bypass logic that prevented skips at reversal points
```javascript
// Removed this problematic bypass:
if (currentIndex === -1 || currentIndex === state.players.length) {
    currentIndex = currentIndex === -1 ? 0 : state.players.length - 1;
}
```

### 3. Double Next Gain Effect for Shops
**Problem**: Double gain effect only worked on actions, not shops
**Solution**: Added doubling checks to major shop benefits:
- Yellow R2/R3 shops (gain 4/5 gems)
- Silver R3 shop (gain 7 silver)
- Gold R1/R2/R3 shops (all gold gains)

### 4. UI Improvements
- Removed player number badges (1,2,3,4) from player cards
- Moved Round and Turn indicators from top to sidebar
- Players now show only name and emoji

### 5. Syntax Error Fixes
Fixed multiple bracket mismatches that prevented game from loading:
- Missing closing brace in END_TURN case
- Extra closing brace after do-while loop
- Mismatched brackets in modal rendering

### 6. Play 2 Workers Edge Case
**Problem**: Players couldn't end turn when out of workers but had "Play 2 More Workers" active
**Solution**: Allow turn end when workers to place but none available

## Current Bug Status

### âœ… Fixed Today
1. Shop cost reduction now player-specific
2. Skip turns working in snake draft  
3. Double next gain effect expanded to shops
4. UI improvements (badges removed, indicators moved)
5. Play 2 Workers edge case
6. Multiple syntax errors

### ðŸ”´ Still Broken (High Priority)
1. **Purple R1 shop cost** - Taking 2 purple instead of 1 purple + 2 any
2. **Force red placement** - Players can't select red actions when forced
3. **Blue automatic VP** - Not triggering despite automaticVPs.blue = true
4. **Shop state persistence** - closedShops not carrying between rounds
5. **Double next gain for actions** - Many actions still don't check for doubling

## Key Code Changes

### Shop Cost Modifier (Lines ~6765, 7402, 7553, 7649)
```javascript
// Changed from:
anyRequired = Math.max(0, anyRequired + state.shopCostModifier);

// To:
const currentPlayer = state.players.find(p => p.id === state.currentPlayer);
anyRequired = Math.max(0, anyRequired + (currentPlayer?.shopCostModifier || 0));
```

### Skip Turn Logic (Lines 614-660)
```javascript
// Now properly handles snake draft reversals
do {
    // Skip logic without bypass
} while (state.skippedTurns[nextPlayer] > 0);
```

### Double Gain Implementation Example
```javascript
const hasDoubleEffect = (player.effects || []).some(effect => 
    effect.includes('Next gain will be doubled'));

if (hasDoubleEffect) {
    Object.keys(finalGems).forEach(color => {
        finalGems[color] *= 2;
    });
    // Remove effect after use
}
```

## Architecture Insights

### Multiplayer Sync Issues
- Most bugs were caused by global state being synced to all players
- Per-player state needs careful handling in Firebase sync
- Need to ensure player-specific properties are preserved

### Syntax Error Prevention
- React.createElement syntax is fragile with nested structures
- Bracket matching is critical with complex component trees
- Always verify closing brackets match opening ones

## Testing Approach

### Abandoned Automated Testing
Created `multiplayer-test.html` but abandoned due to complexity:
- Side-by-side game instances
- Automated state comparison
- Too much overhead for current needs

### Current Debug Tools
- `?debug=true` mode
- Console logging
- Manual multiplayer testing

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Purple R1 shop** - Debug automatic gem selection fallback
2. **Fix force red placement** - Check canPlaceWorker validation
3. **Fix blue automatic VP** - Add debug logging to track state
4. **Complete doubling effect** - Consider infrastructure vs action-by-action
5. **Deploy fixes** - Current changes ready for production
