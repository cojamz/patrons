# CONTEXT SNAPSHOT - January 9, 2025
## Complete Project State for Context Recovery

## 🎮 WHAT WORKS

### Core Game Mechanics
- **Worker placement** - All basic placement, validation, and restrictions work
- **Resource system** - Gain, trade, and spend resources functioning correctly
- **Shop system** - All shops purchasable with proper costs and benefits
- **Turn order** - Snake draft with VP-based ordering works properly
- **Round advancement** - Proper progression through 3 rounds
- **Victory points** - Calculation and display accurate
- **Local play** - Single-player mode fully functional

### Recently Fixed (Today)
1. **Shop cost modifiers** - Now properly player-specific
2. **Skip turns in snake draft** - Fixed double-skip at reversal points
3. **Persistent effects** - "Can place 2 more workers" clears between turns
4. **Force red placement** - Only validates current round actions
5. **End Turn button** - Visual feedback when turn is complete
6. **Resource waste warnings** - Confirmable dialogs prevent accidents
7. **Swap worker restrictions** - Cannot swap onto/off swap actions
8. **Blue R3 shop inclusion** - VP shops now properly included
9. **UI layout stability** - No more shifts when modals open
10. **showPlayerSelection() undefined** - All instances replaced with selectTargetPlayer

## 🐛 CRITICAL BUGS REMAINING

### 1. **Purple R1 Shop Cost Bug**
- **Issue**: Takes 2 purple instead of 1 purple + 2 any
- **Location**: Lines 6550-6590 (automatic gem selection)
- **Cause**: Fallback logic when modal is cancelled

### 2. **Blue Automatic VP Not Triggering**
- **Issue**: automaticVPs.blue = true but no VP awarded
- **Debug**: Add logging in shop purchase handlers

### 3. **Shop State Persistence**
- **Issue**: closedShops resets between rounds
- **Location**: ADVANCE_ROUND handler
- **Fix**: Preserve closedShops array

## 🌐 MULTIPLAYER ARCHITECTURE STATUS

### Current Implementation
- **Technology**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Pattern**: Full state sync on every change
- **Issues**: Race conditions, infinite loops, 10-15KB per sync
- **Stability**: Playable but fragile

### Key Problems
1. **No authoritative server** - Every client can modify state
2. **Race conditions** - Simultaneous actions overwrite each other
3. **Performance** - Syncing entire state is inefficient
4. **Modal conflicts** - State updates during modal interactions

### Recommendations
**Short-term**: Patch critical issues (8 hours work)
1. Add state versioning (2 hours)
2. Fix infinite sync loops (2 hours)
3. Queue modal actions (3 hours)
4. Add action log (1 hour)

**Long-term**: Migrate to action-based sync
- Send actions instead of full state (100x smaller)
- Natural conflict resolution via action ordering
- Better debugging and replay capability

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT PATTERNS AND GOTCHAS

### State Management
```javascript
// ALWAYS use currentState in async operations
const currentState = getState();
// NOT: state (can be stale in closures)
```

### Modal Pattern
```javascript
// Working pattern for player selection (using selectTargetPlayer)
const targetId = await selectTargetPlayer(dispatch, otherPlayers, 'Choose a player to steal from');

// Or using showChoice for custom options
const playerOptions = otherPlayers.map(p => ({
    label: `Player ${p.id}`,
    value: p.id
}));
const targetId = await showChoice(dispatch, 'Choose player', playerOptions);
```

### Shop Cost Calculation
```javascript
// Always apply modifiers
const actualCost = calculateActualCost(shop.cost, currentPlayer.shopCostModifier);
```

### Worker Placement Validation
```javascript
// Check: phase, workers available, space occupied, force red
if (state.waitingForOthers || 
    currentPlayer.workers <= 0 ||
    state.occupiedSpaces[actionId]) return;
```

### Effect Cleanup
```javascript
// Clear temporary effects between turns
workersToPlace: 0,
forceRedPlacement: false,
shopCostModifier: 0
```

## 🎯 NEXT PRIORITY ITEMS

### Critical (Do First)
1. **Fix Purple R1 shop cost** - Incorrect gem calculation
2. **Debug Blue automatic VP** - Major mechanic not working
3. **Fix shop state persistence** - Affects strategy

### High Priority
4. **Multiplayer state versioning** - Prevent race conditions
5. **Action queue system** - Handle concurrent actions
6. **Improve sync performance** - Reduce data transfer

### Medium Priority
7. **UI polish** - Phase indicators, animations
8. **Rules reference** - In-game help system
9. **Error boundaries** - Prevent full crashes

## 🚀 QUICK REFERENCE

### Common Development Tasks

#### Testing a Fix
```bash
# 1. Open in browser
open react-game.html

# 2. Test locally first
# 3. Test with multiple browser tabs
# 4. Check console for errors
```

#### Finding Code
```javascript
// Action implementations: ~3000-4500
// Shop implementations: ~5500-7500
// Modal functions: ~7800-8200
// Game reducers: ~200-2200
// Multiplayer sync: ~8400-8600
```

#### Adding Debug Logging
```javascript
console.log('[DEBUG] Function Name:', {
    state: currentState,
    action: action,
    result: result
});
```

#### Common Validation Patterns
```javascript
// Check current player
if (playerId !== state.currentPlayer) return;

// Check resources
if (!hasEnoughResources(player, cost)) return;

// Check phase
if (state.waitingForOthers) return;
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Quick deploy script exists
node quick-deploy.js

# Or use GitHub upload
node github-upload.js
```

### Key Game States
- **currentPlayer** - Whose turn it is
- **occupiedSpaces** - Which actions have workers
- **round** - Current round (1-3)
- **gameOver** - Whether game has ended
- **waitingForOthers** - Shop phase active
- **forceRedPlacement** - Must place on red
- **workersToPlace** - Extra workers this turn

### Resource Colors
- 🟥 Red, 🟨 Yellow, 🟦 Blue, 🟩 Green
- 🟪 Purple, ⚪ Silver, ⚫ Black, 🟨 Gold (wild)
