# v0 Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation specific to the v0 monolithic implementation.

## Files

- **CODE_INDEX.md** - Line number reference for react-game.html (9,459 lines)
- **DEVELOPER_README.md** - Developer guide for v0 structure
- **MASTER_CONTEXT.md** - AI assistant context document for v0

## Why Archived?

These documents contain line numbers and references specific to the v0 single-file structure. They are no longer accurate for the v0.5 modular implementation.

## Replacement Documentation

Current documentation for v0.5:
- **DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive developer guide
- **CODE_NAVIGATION.md** - File structure and navigation
- **CLAUDE.md** - AI assistant context (updated for v0.5)
- **README.md** - Project overview (updated for v0.5)

## Historical Value

These documents are useful for:
- Understanding the v0 architecture
- Reference when investigating old commits
- Learning about the migration process
- Seeing how the project evolved

**Note**: Line numbers and file references in these docs are for react-game.html (v0), not the current src/ structure.
